# Vulnerability Management Program Implementation

In this project, we simulate the implementation of a comprehensive vulnerability management program, from inception to completion.

_**Inception State:**_ the organization has no existing policy or vulnerability management practices in place.

_**Completion State:**_ a formal policy is enacted, stakeholder buy-in is secured, and a full cycle of organization-wide vulnerability remediation is successfully completed.

### Step 2) Mock Meeting: Policy Buy-In (Stakeholders)

In this phase, a meeting with the server team introduces the draft Vulnerability Management Policy and assesses their capability to meet remediation timelines. Feedback leads to adjustments, like extending the critical remediation window from 48 hours to one week, ensuring collaborative implementation.

### Vulnerability Remediation Policy Discussion

**Participants:** Bob, Sam  
**Topic:** Remediation timelines for vulnerability management policy

---

## Summary

Bob and Sam discussed the proposed vulnerability remediation policy, focusing on whether the current timelines are realistic given existing staffing levels. Bob raised concerns about the aggressive **48-hour remediation window for critical vulnerabilities**, noting that the current team may not be able to consistently meet that target.

Sam acknowledged the concern and suggested a compromise approach to allow teams time to adjust to the new policy.

---

## Key Decisions

- The **48-hour remediation window** may be too aggressive for normal operations.
- A **one-week remediation window for critical vulnerabilities** will be considered as a more practical starting point.
- The **48-hour timeline will be reserved for severe cases**, such as **zero-day vulnerabilities**.
- Departments will receive **approximately six months to adjust** after the policy is finalized.

---

## Action Items

- **Sam:** Update the policy draft to reflect the proposed remediation timeline adjustments.
- **Bob:** Begin preparing the team for the new remediation and patching process.
- **Both:** Continue collaboration during the policy rollout period.

---

## Conversation
**Sam:**  
Hey, morning Bob. How has everything been recently? I know everyone’s been busy these last few weeks.

**Bob:**  
Good morning, Sam. Yeah, it’s been a bit hectic, but we’re hanging in there. Thanks for asking.  

I had a chance to read through the policy draft, and overall it makes sense. However, with our current staffing, we can’t meet the aggressive remediation timelines—especially the **48-hour window for critical vulnerabilities**.

**Sam:**  
Yeah, I totally understand. It is a bit aggressive, especially to start. Perhaps we can extend the critical remediation window to **one week**. That might be a good compromise for now. Then we can reserve the **48-hour window** for truly severe cases, like **zero-day vulnerabilities**.

**Bob:**  
Yeah, that sounds reasonable. We appreciate the flexibility. Can we also have a bit of leeway in the beginning as we get used to the remediation and patching process—just for the first few months?

**Sam:**  
Absolutely. After the policy is finalized, we’ll officially start the program. We’re planning to give all departments about **six months to adjust** and get comfortable with the new process.

**Bob:**  
Thanks, Sam. We’ll do our best. I appreciate you including us in the decision-making process. It really helps us feel like we’re part of the solution.

**Sam:**  
Of course. We’re all in this together. Thanks for working with us.

**Bob:**  
No problem. Thanks for the short meeting.

**Sam:**  
Yeah, those are my favorite types.

**Bob:**  
Bye now.

**Sam:**  
See you later.

### Step 4) Mock Meeting: Initial Scan Permission (Server Team)

The team collaborates with the server team to initiate scheduled credential scans. A compromise is reached to scan a single server first, monitoring resource impact, and using just-in-time Active Directory credentials for secure, controlled access.  

### Meeting Notes: Sam and Bob – Vulnerability Scanning Setup

**Participants:** Sam, Bob  
**Topic:** Planning and initiating credentialed vulnerability scans

---

## Summary

Sam and Bob discussed the next step in the vulnerability management program: conducting scheduled credentialed vulnerability scans across the server infrastructure. Sam explained how the scans work and why administrative credentials are required to properly assess systems.

Bob raised concerns about potential server performance impact and the security risks of providing administrative credentials for all machines. To address these concerns, they agreed to begin with a **single-server test scan** and monitor resource utilization.

They also discussed creating **temporary Active Directory credentials** that would only be enabled during scans to reduce security risk.

---

## Key Decisions

- Vulnerability scans will be conducted **weekly** across the server infrastructure.
- Initial scans will be **credentialed scans** to provide deeper vulnerability detection.
- A **test scan on a single server** will be performed first to monitor system impact.
- Administrative credentials will be handled using a **temporary Active Directory account**.
- The account will follow a **just-in-time access approach**:
  - Disabled by default  
  - Enabled only during scans  
  - Disabled or deprovisioned after scanning completes

---

## Action Items

- **Sam:** Prepare and schedule the initial vulnerability scan.
- **Bob:** Coordinate the creation of a temporary Active Directory account for scanning.
- **Susan:** Automate the provisioning and disabling of the scanning credentials.
- **Both:** Monitor server performance during the initial test scan.

---

## Conversation

**Bob:**  
Morning, Sam.

**Sam:**  
Good morning. I heard you're ready to conduct some scans.

**Bob:**  
Yep. Now that our vulnerability management policy is in place, I wanted to start conducting some scheduled credentialed scans of your environment.

**Sam:**  
Sounds good to me. What’s involved? How can we help?

**Bob:**  
We’re planning to schedule weekly scans of the server infrastructure. We estimate it will take about **4–6 hours to scan all 200 assets**.  

We’ll need you to provide some **administrative credentials** so the scan engine can remotely log into the targets and better assess them.

**Sam:**  
Whoa, hold on. What does scanning actually entail? I’m a bit worried about resource utilization. Also, you want admin credentials to all 200 machines? That doesn’t sound very safe.

**Bob:**  
Those are valid concerns. The scan engine sends various types of traffic to the servers to check for specific vulnerabilities.  

This includes things like:
- Checking the registry
- Identifying outdated software
- Detecting insecure protocols or cipher suites

That’s why credentials are required—it allows the scanner to perform deeper checks.

**Sam:**  
I see. Well, as long as it doesn’t bring the servers offline, we should be okay.

**Bob:**  
Absolutely. Let’s start by scanning **a single server** and monitor the resource utilization.

**Sam:**  
Not a bad idea.

**Bob:**  
Great. Also, for the credentials, could you set up something in **Active Directory** for us?  

You could leave the account disabled until we’re ready to scan. Then enable it during the scan and disable or deprovision it afterward—kind of like a **just-in-time access** setup.

**Sam:**  
That sounds good. I’ll ask Susan to start working on the automation for provisioning the account.

**Bob:**  
Awesome. Okay, talk soon.

**Sam:**  
Sounds good. I’ll get back to you once the credentials are set up.

**Bob:**  
See you later.

**Sam:**  
See you later.

### Step 5) Initial Scan of Server Team Assets

In this phase, an insecure Windows Server is provisioned to simulate the server team's environment. After creating vulnerabilities, an authenticated scan is performed, and the results are exported for future remediation steps.

---

### Step 6) Vulnerability Assessment and Prioritization

We assessed vulnerabilities and established a remediation prioritization strategy based on ease of remediation and impact. The following priorities were set:

1. Third Party Software Removal (Wireshark)
2. Windows OS Secure Configuration (Protocols & Ciphers)
3. Windows OS Secure Configuration (Guest Account Group Membership)
4. Windows OS Updates

---

### Step 7) Distributing Remediations to Remediation Teams

The server team received remediation scripts and scan reports to address key vulnerabilities. This streamlined their efforts and prepared them for a follow-up review.

### On-going Vulnerability Management (Maintenance Mode)

After completing the initial remediation cycle, the vulnerability management program transitions into **Maintenance Mode**. This phase ensures that vulnerabilities continue to be managed proactively, keeping systems secure over time. Regular scans, continuous monitoring, and timely remediation are crucial components of this phase. (See [Finalized Policy](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rvueLX_71pOR8ldN9zVW9r_zLzDQxVsnSUtNar8ftdg/edit?usp=drive_link) for scanning and remediation cadence requirements.)

Key activities in Maintenance Mode include:
- **Scheduled Vulnerability Scans**: Perform regular scans (e.g., weekly or monthly) to detect new vulnerabilities as systems evolve.
- **Patch Management**: Continuously apply security patches and updates, ensuring no critical vulnerabilities remain unpatched.
- **Remediation Follow-ups**: Address newly identified vulnerabilities promptly, prioritizing based on risk and impact.
- **Policy Review and Updates**: Periodically review the Vulnerability Management Policy to ensure it aligns with the latest security best practices and organizational needs.
- **Audit and Compliance**: Conduct internal audits to ensure compliance with the vulnerability management policy and external regulations.
- **Ongoing Communication with Stakeholders**: Maintain open communication with teams responsible for remediation, ensuring efficient coordination.

By maintaining an active vulnerability management process, organizations can stay ahead of emerging threats and ensure long-term security resilience.
